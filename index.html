			<p> The particle fire explosion is a graphical program made using C++, and the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL 2.0</a> library. The particles move in a circular pattern as the background and particle colors change over time. </p>

			<p> This program is a tip calculator, with a graphical user interface (GUI) made using JavaFX. The Textfield on the top is editable so the user can enter an Amount, the Textfields on the bottom for the Tip, and the Total are not editable. All the user has to do is enter an amount, set the tip percentage by moving the slider and hit the calculate button.</p>

			<img src="./JavaFX-GUI-Contacts_App-3.png">

			<p>This program is a Contacts Application made using JavaFx, JDK 11, and styled using CSS, The user can upload a profile image from their computer as long as it is a <b>.jpeg</b>, or <b>.png</b> image file. Then they can enter their first name, last name, phone number, email address, along with their CUNY EMPLID number. Then the user can save this contact so that it appears on the list of contacts on the left side, which is sorted alphabetically,. If the user wants to delete a contact they can select it from the sorted list on the left by clicking it and hitting the delete button, and that contact will be removed from the list. Then when the user has decided that they have added enough contacts and want to export the information while also saving and exiting the program, they can hit the 'Export as a .txt file' button, the program will prompt the user to look for an .txt file within file explorer or Finder, and then it will overwrite the information into the text file, and terminate. </p>

			<p> This is an Animation made using Java FX, and CSS for the rectangle. As the button is pressed the animation plays! This project was the result of me just messing around with JavaFX 2D shapes, Colors, and Animations, which was not part of the required course material in our Software Design Lab class. Although it made for a really fun project! </p>

			<span>
				<p> My interests include playing video games, creating video-games inside the Unity game engine, and watching Anime. My favorite musical artists and composers are deadmau5, Beethoven, Fedrick Chopin, Hiroyuki Sawano, Hanz Zimmer, and Eminem. Regardless of genre I generally prefer non-vocal instrumental music as it keeps me more productive. My hobbies range from writing, to sketching, to building computers, to testing the limits of Gnome3 extensions in Ubuntu, to trying other linux distro's, and making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxel</a> art! </p>
